- Additional crawl insights (template-level issues, duplicate metadata clusters)
- More output targets (SARIF or GitHub summary format)
- Improved report theming for Markdown output

## Longer-term

- Community check registry and example plugins
- Official GitHub Action and Docker image
- Benchmark dataset and regression fixtures for checks
